## Problem Introduction:

Face-to-face instruction is a direct means for students to be able to receive a personalized learning experience and cover material at a specific pace. However, in some instances, this means of learning can be flawed and made difficult for students without the proper schedule. With Athena being the only means for students at UGA to use for class registration, many students have been falsely registering for classes under the impression that their schedule is flexible and manageable. When in reality, it may be the reason they face a difficult circumstance in their upcoming semester. This issue comes as a result of the lack of information provided on classes upfront specifically with class locations. While currently, students receive some relative information on Athena, information in regards to class location is not disclosed upfront often resulting in difficult commitments. There has not been any research or reports of other class registrations systems accomodating for this issue as well. Students can find themselves either leaving or arriving at class 20 to 15 minutes earlier or late simply to compensate for the lecture material of one class over another as a result of opposing class locations. This can prevent students from receiving sufficient lecture material causing them to generally be behind in class. While Professors who like to keep the majority of their students on steady and in-sync pacing would also be negatively impacted. Despite this issue being less prominent with students who enroll for hybrid-instruction or online instruction, students who prominently learn face-to-face should not be forced to engage in a different learning environment to combat this issue. This problem requires a long-term solution. Our mission as Team C.A.C is to use our extensive research and understanding to formulate the best solution to this problem and hopefully solve an issue that many students face every semester.

We proposed user experience requirements into three different user experiences. After analyzing the relevant cases, we made an ideation and preliminary design for each one. These preliminary designs are low fidelity wireframes on different ideas to solve each specific user story. Once we picked out the best ideas for each low-fidelity wireframe, we went into more detail on our designs and decided on what could be added or removed to improve the designs. We hope you enjoy.
